# Spectre
 A Vulkan based game engine
## For Windows systems:
A dirty hack to get GLM's library path is to copy the library in your compiler's include folder.
## Dependencies :
You'll need GLM and Vulkan for Windows users. For Linux users, you will need in addition the xcb and xcb-util package (used for window communication with the X server). Also, the program won't work if you use a Wayland windowing system.
