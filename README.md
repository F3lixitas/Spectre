# Spectre
 A Vulkan based game engine
## For Windows systems:
You'll need to configure a config.txt file for the GLM, GLFW paths and wether you are using visual studio or not. A template file can be found here : 
## Dependencies :
You'll need GLM and Vulkan for Windows users. For Linux users, you will need in addition the xcb and xcb-util package (used for window communication with the X server). Also, the program won't work if you use a Wayland windowing system.
